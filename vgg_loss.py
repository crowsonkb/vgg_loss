    normalized to the range 0–1.

    computed for the input and target at layer :attr:`layer` (default 8, or
    ``relu2_2``) of the pretrained model specified by :attr:`model` (either
    ``'vgg16'`` (default) or ``'vgg19'``).

    If :attr:`shift` is nonzero, a random shift of at most :attr:`shift`
    pixels in both height and width will be applied to all images in the input
    and target. The shift will only be applied when the loss function is in
    training mode, and will not be applied if a precomputed feature map is
    supplied as the target.

    target over and over. To use the precomputed features, pass them in as
